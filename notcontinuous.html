Let’s solve the problem from the provided image step by step. The problem states:
Problem 1: Use the sequential characterization of continuity to show that the function
f(x) = \begin{cases} 
1, & x \geq 0 \\
0, & x < 0 
\end{cases}

is NOT continuous at 
x = 0
.
Step-by-Step Solution
Step 1: Understand the sequential characterization of continuity
A function ( f ) is continuous at a point 
x = a
 if, for every sequence 
\{x_n\}
 converging to ( a ) (i.e., 
\lim_{n \to \infty} x_n = a
), the sequence of function values 
\{f(x_n)\}
 converges to ( f(a) ) (i.e., 
\lim_{n \to \infty} f(x_n) = f(a)
). If we can find a sequence 
\{x_n\}
 converging to ( a ) such that 
\lim_{n \to \infty} f(x_n) \neq f(a)
, then ( f ) is not continuous at ( a ).
Here, 
a = 0
, and we need to check continuity at 
x = 0
. First, compute ( f(0) ):

    Since 
    0 \geq 0
    , 
    f(0) = 1
    .

Step 2: Construct a sequence converging to 
x = 0
To test discontinuity, we need a sequence 
\{x_n\}
 that approaches 0 from different sides (since the function definition changes at 
x = 0
). Let’s consider a sequence approaching 0 from the left (where 
x < 0
) and another from the right (where 
x \geq 0
).

    Define a sequence 
    \{x_n\}
     where 
    x_n = -\frac{1}{n}
     for 
    n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots
    .
        For all ( n ), 
        x_n < 0
         because 
        -\frac{1}{n} < 0
        .
        As 
        n \to \infty
        , 
        x_n = -\frac{1}{n} \to 0
         (since the negative sign is fixed, and the magnitude 
        \frac{1}{n} \to 0
        ).

Step 3: Evaluate 
f(x_n)

    Since 
    x_n = -\frac{1}{n} < 0
    , we use the second part of the piecewise definition:
    f(x_n) = f\left(-\frac{1}{n}\right) = 0 \quad \text{for all } n.
    Thus, the sequence 
    \{f(x_n)\}
     is 
    \{0, 0, 0, \ldots\}
    , which converges to 0 as 
    n \to \infty
    .

Step 4: Compare with ( f(0) )

    We have 
    f(0) = 1
    .
    The limit of 
    f(x_n)
     as 
    n \to \infty
     is 0.
    Since 
    \lim_{n \to \infty} f(x_n) = 0 \neq 1 = f(0)
    , the sequential characterization of continuity is violated.

Step 5: Conclusion
The existence of a sequence 
\{x_n\} = \{-\frac{1}{n}\}
 converging to 0 such that 
\lim_{n \to \infty} f(x_n) = 0 \neq f(0) = 1
 demonstrates that ( f ) is not continuous at 
x = 0
.
Final Answer
The function ( f(x) ) is NOT continuous at 
x = 0
, as shown using the sequential characterization of continuity.
